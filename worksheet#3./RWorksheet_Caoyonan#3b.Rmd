#1. Create a data frame using the table below.

#a. Write the codes.
household <- data.frame(
  Sex = c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female",    "Male"),
  
  Types_of_Houses = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete", "Wood", "Concrete"),
  
  Fathers_Occupation = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others", "Farmer", "Driver"),
  
  Num_Siblings_Attending = c(4, 6, 5, 3, 7)
) 


#b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data
str(household)
summary(household)


#c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
mean(household$Num_Siblings_Attending) == 5


#d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the sub-setting functions. Write the codes and its output.
household[1:2, ]


#e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
household[c(3,5), c(2,4)]
#Output: 
#       Types_of_Houses
#     3  Semi_Concrete
#     5  Concrete


#f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses. Write the codes.
types_houses <- household$Types_of_Houses
types_houses
#Output: 
#[1] "Wood"          "Concrete"     
#[3] "Semi-Concrete" "Wood"         
#[5] "Concrete" 


#g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the codes and its output.
subset(household, Sex == "Male" & Fathers_Occupation == "Farmer")
#Output:

#     Sex        Types_of_Houses
#  1  Male      Wood


#h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.
subset(household, Sex == "Female" & Num_Siblings_Attending >= 5)
#Output:
#       Sex       Types_of_Houses
#    2  Female    Concrete


#2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:

df <- data.frame(
  Ints = integer(),
  Doubles = double(),
  Characters = character(),
  Logicals = logical(),
  Factors = factor(),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
str(df)


#a. Describe the results.
#Describe: The result shows that the empty data frame has 0 rows and 5 columns with different data types.


#3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv
write.csv(household, "HouseholdData.csv", row.names = FALSE)


#a. Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.
HouseholdData <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")
HouseholdData


#b. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it into integer.[Legend: Male = 1 and Female = 2]. Write the R codes and its output.
HouseholdData$Sex <- factor(HouseholdData$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"), labels = c(1, 2))
HouseholdData
#Output: 


#c. Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer. [Legend: Wood = 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3]. Write the R codes and its output.
HouseholdData$Types_of_Houses <- factor(
  HouseholdData$Types_of_Houses,
  levels = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete"),
  labels = c(1, 2, 3)
)
HouseholdData
#Output:


#d. On fatherâ€™s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3. What is the R code and its output?
HouseholdData$Fathers_Occupation <- factor(
  HouseholdData$Fathers_Occupation,
  levels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"),
  labels = c(1, 2, 3)
)
HouseholdData
#Output:


#e. Select only all females respondent that has a father whose occupation is driver. Write the codes and its output.
subset(HouseholdData, Sex == 2 & Fathers_Occupation == 2)
#Output: 


#f. Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its output.
subset(HouseholdData, Num_Siblings_Attending >= 5)
#Output:
